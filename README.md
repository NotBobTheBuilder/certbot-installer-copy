# This was certbot-installer-copy
certbot installer plugin to move certificates to a specific volume. Moves certificates themselves, not symlinks. Ideal companion to certbot in a container

# Replaced by [certbot-filecopy-installer](https://github.com/NotBobTheBuilder/certbot-filecopy-installer)

certbot-filecopy-installer is still [available on github](https://github.com/NotBobTheBuilder/certbot-filecopy-installer) but is also [published to pypi](https://pypi.org/project/certbot-filecopy-installer/)
